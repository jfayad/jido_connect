# Pi Connector Factory

Small Beadwork-driven wrapper for letting Pi + Z.ai implement one connector task
at a time in this repo.

Beadwork is the backlog and state system. Codex should create and refine
connector tasks in `bw`; this wrapper only selects ready Beadwork tasks and asks
Pi to implement them.

## Setup

```sh
cd pi-connector-factory
cp .env.example .env
$EDITOR .env
bun install
npm install -g @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent
```

## Commands

Check local wiring:

```sh
bun run doctor
```

Run exactly one ready Beadwork task:

```sh
bun run step
```

Run one specific task:

```sh
bun run step -- --issue jido_con-abc
```

Run a Ralph-style loop, one Beadwork task at a time:

```sh
bun run loop -- --limit 5
```

Preview the exact Pi prompt for the next task:

```sh
bun run prompt
```

## Contract

Each `step`:

- Requires a clean Git worktree before Pi starts.
- Selects one ready Beadwork task, excluding epics by default.
- Starts the task with `bw start`.
- Runs Pi with Z.ai `glm-5.1`.
- Requires Pi to make exactly one commit on the current branch.
- Requires the worktree to be clean after that commit.
- Closes the Beadwork task after the commit succeeds.

If no non-epic Beadwork task is ready, Codex needs to split an epic into child
tasks first.
