# Milestone 2: Google Connectors

## Goal

Build the Google connector family on top of the hardened `jido_connect` foundation without turning Google into one oversized provider package. The milestone should prove the connector factory can support a broad, high-value SaaS surface with strict auth, scope, catalog, and normalized data contracts.

The recommended package shape is a shared Google foundation plus focused provider packages:

- `jido_connect_google`
- `jido_connect_google_sheets`
- `jido_connect_gmail`
- `jido_connect_google_drive`
- `jido_connect_google_calendar`

Likely follow-on Google packages after the first Workspace wave:

- `jido_connect_google_contacts`
- `jido_connect_google_meet`
- `jido_connect_google_analytics`
- `jido_connect_google_search_console`

The shared package should own OAuth helpers, Google account/profile normalization, shared transport behavior, scope metadata, error mapping, pagination conventions, webhook/watch helpers where they are genuinely common, and reusable Zoi structs. Product packages should own product-specific DSL specs, handlers, schemas, normalized resource structs, and tests.

## Non-Goals

- Do not build one giant `jido_connect_google_workspace` package in this milestone.
- Do not add Google endpoint logic to `jido_connect` core.
- Do not require host apps to persist credentials, connections, or checkpoints in a package-owned store.
- Do not start with broad Gmail/Drive restricted scopes when narrower scopes can support the workflow.
- Do not adopt generated Google API clients blindly; spike them behind a facade before committing.

## Hex Package Research

| Package | Use | Recommendation | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [`google_api_sheets`](https://hex.pm/packages/google_api_sheets) | Generated Sheets API client | Spike | Good coverage, but likely needs facade wrapping for Jido errors, scopes, normalization, and tests. |
| [`google_api_gmail`](https://hex.pm/packages/google_api_gmail) | Generated Gmail API client | Spike carefully | Useful for surface discovery, but Gmail scopes and payload privacy need strict boundaries. |
| [`google_api_drive`](https://hex.pm/packages/google_api_drive) | Generated Drive API client | Spike carefully | Drive has broad/restricted scope risks; prefer narrow operations and `drive.file` where possible. |
| [`google_api_calendar`](https://hex.pm/packages/google_api_calendar) | Generated Calendar API client | Spike | Calendar is a good early product connector after Sheets because event/freebusy workflows are common. |
| [`google_api_people`](https://hex.pm/packages/google_api_people) | Generated People/Contacts API client | Later | Useful for contacts, enrichment, Gmail recipients, and Calendar attendee workflows. |
| [`google_api_meet`](https://hex.pm/packages/google_api_meet) | Generated Meet API client | Later | Useful for meeting spaces, conference records, participants, recordings, and transcripts. |
| [`google_api_analytics_data`](https://hex.pm/packages/google_api_analytics_data) | Generated GA4 Analytics Data API client | Later | Belongs in a measurement/marketing track; report schemas need careful normalization. |
| [`google_api_search_console`](https://hex.pm/packages/google_api_search_console) | Generated Search Console API client | Later | Useful for site/search analytics, sitemap management, and URL inspection. |
| [`google_api_pub_sub`](https://hex.pm/packages/google_api_pub_sub) | Pub/Sub API client | Later | Useful for Gmail/Drive push/watch flows if hosts want Google Pub/Sub integration. Not needed for the first action-first pass. |
| [`google_api_oauth2`](https://hex.pm/packages/google_api_oauth2) | Userinfo/tokeninfo APIs | Optional | Useful for account identity verification and profile enrichment. Not the main OAuth flow. |
| [`goth`](https://hex.pm/packages/goth) | Google service account tokens | Later/foundation-compatible | Best for service-account and server-to-server auth. Keep OAuth user auth first, then add service accounts/domain delegation deliberately. |
| [`oauth2`](https://hex.pm/packages/oauth2) | Generic OAuth 2.0 client | Candidate | Fits reusable OAuth exchange/refresh helpers if current internal OAuth helpers need a dependency. |
| [`assent`](https://hex.pm/packages/assent) | OAuth/OIDC strategies | Optional host-facing spike | Useful in Phoenix auth flows, but may be too host-app oriented for connector runtime. |
| [`ueberauth_google`](https://hex.pm/packages/ueberauth_google) | Phoenix authentication strategy | Host-app concern | Good for sign-in, less useful as a connector package runtime dependency. |

Current package stance:

- Treat generated `google_api_*` clients as implementation candidates, not as the public connector API.
- Keep public facades and handler contracts in Jido packages stable even if the underlying client choice changes.
- Prefer the existing `Jido.Connect.Provider.Transport` style unless a generated client clearly reduces risk.
- Preserve sanitized provider errors and normalized resource structs regardless of client backend.

## Auth And Scope Strategy

Google should support multiple auth profiles over time, but Milestone 2 should start narrowly.

### Auth Profiles

- `:user` OAuth profile first.
- `:service_account` profile later for server-owned workflows.
- `:domain_delegated_service_account` later for Workspace admin/domain delegation.

The shared `jido_connect_google` package should model these as first-class auth alternatives so product operations can declare exactly what they support.

### Scope Rules

Use dynamic scope resolution aggressively. Google scopes are workflow-dependent, especially for Drive and Gmail.

Reference docs:

- [Sheets API scopes](https://developers.google.com/workspace/sheets/api/scopes)
- [Gmail API scopes](https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/auth/scopes)
- [Drive API scopes](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/api-specific-auth)
- [Calendar API scopes](https://developers.google.com/workspace/calendar/api/auth)

Initial scope posture:

- Sheets: prefer spreadsheet-level scopes for sheet operations; use Drive scopes only when file discovery/creation requires them.
- Gmail: split send/draft/label/metadata/read/modify workflows so hosts can avoid restricted scopes until they explicitly need them.
- Drive: prefer `drive.file` and metadata scopes before broad Drive scopes.
- Calendar: start with freebusy and event CRUD scopes, split readonly and write operations.

## Build Waves

### Wave 2.0: Shared Google Foundation

Package: `jido_connect_google`

Deliverables:

- Google OAuth profile and connection metadata normalization.
- Token refresh helper compatible with `CredentialLease`.
- Google account/userinfo normalization.
- Shared Google transport helper or generated-client facade boundary.

- Scope catalog and dynamic scope resolver helpers.
- Shared pagination helpers for page tokens.
- Shared webhook/watch primitives only if they are reusable across Gmail/Drive/Calendar.
- README with Phoenix host integration notes.

Acceptance:

- A product connector can depend on `jido_connect_google` without pulling Slack/GitHub code.
- A host can create a user OAuth connection and mint a short-lived lease.
- Shared helpers are storage-free and testable without live Google credentials.

- `Google.Calendar.FreeBusy`

Catalog packs:

- `google_calendar_reader`
- `google_calendar_scheduler`

### Wave 2.5: Google Contacts

Package: `jido_connect_google_contacts`

Backed by the People API. This should be a follow-on package because it is useful across Gmail, Calendar, and CRM-style workflows, but it is not required to prove the first Google connector foundation.

Initial actions:

- `Google.Contacts.Organization`

Catalog packs:

- `google_contacts_readonly`
- `google_contacts_manager`

### Wave 2.6: Google Meet

Catalog packs:

- `google_meet_reader`
- `google_meet_scheduler`

### Wave 2.7: Google Analytics

Package: `jido_connect_google_analytics`

Analytics should be treated as a measurement connector, not a Workspace connector. Start with GA4 reporting through the Analytics Data API. Admin/property management can be a later expansion.

Initial actions:

- `google.analytics.report.run`
- `google.analytics.report.batch_run`

Catalog packs:

- `google_analytics_reader`
- `google_analytics_reporter`

### Wave 2.8: Google Search Console

Package: `jido_connect_google_search_console`

Search Console belongs near Analytics because both feed marketing, SEO, and reporting workflows. It should stay separate from Analytics because auth, resources, and normalized outputs are different.

Initial actions:

- `google.search_console.site.list`
- `google.search_console.site.add`
- `google.search_console.search_analytics.query`
- `google.search_console.sitemap.list`
- `google.search_console.sitemap.submit`
- `google.search_console.url.inspect`

Normalized structs:

- `Google.SearchConsole.Site`
- `Google.SearchConsole.SearchAnalyticsReport`

- `Google.SearchConsole.Sitemap`
- `Google.SearchConsole.UrlInspectionResult`

Catalog packs:

- `google_search_console_reader`
- `google_search_console_seo`

### Wave 2.9: Cross-Google Hardening

Deliverables:

- Shared fixtures and golden HTTP tests.
- Scope-minimization tests for each operation.
- Catalog search and pack examples across Google products.
- Demo Phoenix OAuth flow for Google.
- Optional generated-client ADR.
- Optional service-account/domain-delegation ADR.
- Push/watch persistence design for Gmail, Drive, Calendar, and Meet.

## Generated Client Spike

Before implementing many endpoints by hand, create a spike comparing two approaches for each product:

- Generated `google_api_*` client behind a Jido facade.
- Handwritten small Req clients using shared Google transport.

Evaluate:

- Test ergonomics.
- Error normalization.
- Sanitized failure details.
- Request shape visibility.
- Scope and auth profile control.
- Dependency size and transitive dependencies.
- Long-term maintainability for 100+ connectors.

The production connector API should remain the same regardless of the chosen backend.

## First Beadwork Epics

Create epics in this order:

- `Milestone 2: Google connector family`
- `Google foundation: OAuth, transport, scopes, and account identity`
- `Google generated-client spike`
- `Google Sheets connector`
- `Gmail connector`
- `Google Drive connector`
- `Google Calendar connector`
- `Google Contacts connector`
- `Google Meet connector`
- `Google Analytics connector`
- `Google Search Console connector`
- `Google cross-product hardening and demo`

Suggested first task set:

- Scaffold `jido_connect_google`.
- Add Google OAuth profile and account metadata structs.
- Add Google token refresh helper.
- Add Google scope catalog and dynamic resolver helpers.
- Spike `google_api_sheets` behind a facade.
- Implement Sheets read-only actions.
- Add Sheets writer actions.
- Add catalog packs for Sheets.
- Write the Google host integration README.

## Beadwork Backlog Plan

Use this section as the source of truth when loading Milestone 2 into Beadwork. Each epic and story has a stable planning ID so dependencies can be preserved even if Beadwork assigns different issue IDs.

### Current Status

| Planning ID | Beadwork epic | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| G00 | `[G00] Milestone Orchestration` | Closed after importing epics, tasks, labels, and dependencies. |
| G01 | `[G01] Shared Google Foundation` | Closed after adding the initial shared Google package, auth metadata, OAuth refresh, transport, scopes, pagination, tests, and README. |
| G02 | `[G02] Generated-Client Spike` | In progress. |
| G03 | `[G03] Google Sheets Connector` | Blocked by G01 and G02. |
| G04 | `[G04] Gmail Connector` | Blocked by Sheets proving the package pattern. |
| G05 | `[G05] Google Drive Connector` | Blocked by Sheets proving the package pattern. |
| G06 | `[G06] Google Calendar Connector` | Blocked by Sheets proving the package pattern. |
| G07 | `[G07] Google Contacts Connector` | Blocked by Gmail and Calendar. |
| G08 | `[G08] Google Meet Connector` | Blocked by Calendar. |
| G09 | `[G09] Google Analytics Connector` | Blocked by Sheets proving the package pattern. |
| G10 | `[G10] Google Search Console Connector` | Blocked by Analytics. |
| G11 | `[G11] Cross-Google Hardening And Demo` | Blocked by product connector waves. |

Suggested Beadwork mapping:

- Create one Beadwork epic per `Gxx` section.
- Create one Beadwork story per `Gxx-Syy` row.
- Put the planning ID at the start of each issue title, for example `[G01-S01] Scaffold shared Google package`.
- Translate `Depends on` into Beadwork blocking relationships.
- Keep implementation issues small enough that the Beadwork Codex loop can finish one story, format, test, and commit cleanly.

## Verification

Use the existing quality bar after each package wave:

```sh
mix format --check-formatted
mix compile --warnings-as-errors
mix test
mix quality
cd dev/demo && mix format --check-formatted && mix clean && mix compile --warnings-as-errors && mix test
```

Provider packages should also include focused tests for:

- Dynamic scopes.
- Lease expiration and connection mismatch paths.
- Provider HTTP error sanitization.
- Catalog search, describe, and call behavior.
- Normalized Zoi structs.
- Generated Jido actions/sensors.

## Open Questions

- Should the generated Google API packages be runtime dependencies, dev/test references, or only research aids?
- Should `jido_connect_google` expose a generic Google token refresh helper or only auth-profile metadata and leave refresh to hosts?
- How much service-account support belongs in Milestone 2 versus a later admin/workspace milestone?
- What is the durable persistence contract for Google watch channels and poll checkpoints?
- Should Google product packages live under `jido_connect_google_*` names consistently, or should high-brand products use shorter names like `jido_connect_gmail`?
