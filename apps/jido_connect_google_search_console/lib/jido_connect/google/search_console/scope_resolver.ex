  Resolves Google Search Console scopes.

  Search Console exposes both read-only reporting operations and write
  operations for site and sitemap management. The resolver stays package-local
  so later action families can preserve least-privilege behavior without adding
  generic Search Console scope logic to `jido_connect` core.
