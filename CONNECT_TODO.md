# Jido Connect Connector Roadmap

## Overview

`jido_connect` should become a broad connector catalog for Jido agents: provider
packages that compile Spark DSL declarations into generated Jido actions,
sensors, and plugins while keeping auth, credentials, scopes, webhooks, and
provider API behavior behind stable runtime contracts.

This list is seeded from Lindy's public integrations catalog, with their "Most
Popular" section treated as the top popularity signal:

1. Google Sheets
2. Gmail
3. Slack
4. Google Drive
5. HubSpot
6. Calendly
7. Airtable
8. Salesforce

After those, the ranking is a pragmatic build order based on likely Jido agent
utility, category breadth, OAuth complexity reuse, and how much each connector
helps prove reusable core abstractions.

## Ranking Principles

- Build high-frequency agent workflows first: email, files, spreadsheets, CRM,
  calendar, chat, and support.
- Prefer connector families where one auth/client foundation unlocks multiple
  packages, such as Google, Microsoft, Atlassian, and Salesforce ecosystems.
- Keep provider packages thin: DSL, auth helpers, client boundary, handlers,
  webhook helpers, tests.
- Push reusable behavior down into `jido_connect`: OAuth, app installation
  flows, scope resolution, webhooks, pagination, rate limits, error taxonomy,
  availability checks, and local demo harnesses.
- Every connector should ship with generated Jido actions, generated sensors
  where useful, plugin availability, docs, and local test/demo support.

## Status Legend

- `shipped`: package exists in `apps/` and the tracked roadmap scope is complete.
- `in_progress`: package exists or work has started, but the roadmap scope is not
  complete yet.
- `ready`: Beadwork or the roadmap says this should be built soon, but no package
  exists yet.
- `planned`: important, but after the first connector families are stable.
- `later`: useful breadth once the core package is mature.

## Suggested Build Waves

### Wave 0: Seeded Reference Connectors

- GitHub
- Slack
- MCP bridge

These already exist and should remain the reference connectors for auth
alternatives, generated Jido modules, webhook normalization, plugin availability,
and provider client organization.

### Wave 1: Shipped Google And Assistant Core

- Google OAuth foundation
- Google Sheets
- Gmail
- Google Drive
- Google Calendar

This wave is implemented. It proves shared OAuth app setup, sensitive scopes,
refresh handling, cross-package auth reuse, and high-frequency assistant
workflows.

### Wave 2: Current Google Expansion

- Google Contacts
- Google Analytics
- Google Meet
- Google Search Console

Contacts and Analytics are implemented. Meet exists and needs Beadwork cleanup.
Search Console is the active unfinished Google package.

### Wave 3: Ready Google Workspace Tail

- Google Docs
- Google Slides
- Google Forms
- Google Tasks

These ready Beadwork epics should be split into leaf tasks before Pi works
through them.

### Wave 4: Scheduling, Sales, And Data

- Cal.com
- HubSpot
- Airtable
- Calendly
- Salesforce

This wave proves scheduling APIs, CRM object models, search/list/create/update
patterns, webhook/poll parity, and richer schema metadata. Cal.com now has a
partial recovered package; finish webhooks and hardening before Calendly.

### Wave 5: Work Management And Chat Handoffs

- Jira
- Linear
- GitLab
- Azure DevOps

This wave proves issue normalization, threaded comments, assignees/statuses,
webhook dedupe, and `jido_chat` handoff workflows such as "turn this
conversation into an issue" or "summarize this issue thread."

### Wave 6: Product Analytics And Generic Bridge

- PostHog
- Generic HTTP
- Generic Webhook
- MCP bridge expansion

This wave proves analytics/query actions, feature-flag checks, and the generic
long-tail bridge family. Keep HTTP, Webhook, and MCP as separate provider
packages, but make them share auth, credential lease, policy, transport, error,
and catalog contracts.

### Wave 7: Support, Commerce, Payments, And Finance

- Zendesk
- Intercom
- Freshdesk
- Mercury
- Stripe
- Shopify

This wave rounds out support and revenue operations. Mercury and Stripe should
start with read-only or low-risk actions and require explicit host policy for
money movement, payment creation, or account mutation.

### Wave 8: Additional Breadth

- Notion
- Asana
- Trello
- monday.com
- SFTP
- Zoom
- Typeform
- Mailchimp
- ActiveCampaign
- Zoho CRM
- Zoho Desk

These remain useful breadth once the highest-signal assistant, sales, work,
analytics, and bridge packages have established repeatable patterns.

## Core Work Remaining While Scaling

- Keep Beadwork aligned with package state; close stale completed epics and split
  ready epics into leaf tasks before handing them to Pi.
- Standard pagination and cursor helpers across non-Google providers.
- Standard rate-limit and retry metadata in provider errors.
- Dynamic scope requirements at action and input level for every new provider.
- Connection health checks and availability diagnostics.
- Webhook verification helpers with replay/dedupe contracts for non-Google
  providers.
- Finance-grade policy defaults for high-risk write actions.
- Chat handoff conventions for work-management connectors that pair with
  `jido_chat`.
- Provider test harness helpers for Req stubs, OAuth callbacks, app manifests,
  and webhook fixtures.
- Demo UI that can host many integrations without custom pages per provider.
